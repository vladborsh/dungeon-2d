# Dungeon Game - Technical Requirements Specification

## 1. Core Requirements

### Game Overview
- Browser-based 2D Platformer RPG / Dungeon Crawler
- Single-player focused with procedurally generated content
- Built with TypeScript and Canvas2d

### Technical Architecture

- Multiple floor layouts with difficulty scaling
- Deterministic seed system for reproducible dungeons

### Character System
- Stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Speed
- Level progression with XP tracking
- Equipment slots for artifacts
- Collision detection and movement physics

### Combat & AI
- Real-time combat mechanics
- Monster AI with pathfinding
- Damage calculation system
- Status effect framework

### Resource System
- Collectible items (ores, herbs, artifacts)
- Inventory management
- Trading/crafting mechanics
